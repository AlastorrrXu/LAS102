        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="myphoto.png" alt="My Photo">
        <p>Hello! My name is Duorui Xu, and I'm a transfer student at UIUC majoring in Statistics. I'm passionate about data science, especially in statistical computing. My favorite class so far is STAT425, which has helped me apply coding to solve real-world problems. I plan to declare a Computer Science minor to enhance my programming skills.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="inquire">
        <h2>Inquire</h2>
        <p>When I first arrived at UIUC, I was curious about balancing my academic workload with exploring new areas like computer science. Initially, I felt unsure about how well I could manage both. Over time, through classes like STAT425, I gained more confidence in my ability to handle challenging coursework. Although I’ve answered many of my initial questions, I’m still curious about how I can fully utilize the resources available for career development.</p>

    <section id="engage">
        <h2>Engage</h2>
        <p>During the first few weeks, I stepped out of my comfort zone by participating in data science workshops and meeting new people. My favorite class is STAT425 because it combines programming with statistics, which aligns perfectly with my interests. I discovered the Grainger Engineering Library, which has become my favorite study space. Through these experiences, I’ve begun building a community of peers who share similar academic interests.</p>

        <h2>Create - Illini Action Plan</h2>
        <h3>Goal 1: Declare a Computer Science Minor</h3>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> I want to develop a strong foundation in programming to complement my statistics background. The Computer Science minor will provide the necessary skills to enhance my capabilities in data science and machine learning.</p>
        <p><strong>Action Plan:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Meet with my academic advisor to review the requirements for declaring the minor.</li>
            <li>Enroll in foundational CS courses, starting with CS125.</li>
            <li>Attend coding workshops and participate in study groups.</li>
            <li>Declare the minor by the end of this academic year.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Goal 2: Excel in STAT425</h3>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> STAT425 is a crucial course for understanding statistical computing. Mastering this course will provide me with the skills to apply statistical methods in real-world contexts.</p>
        <p><strong>Action Plan:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spend at least 10 hours per week on coursework and assignments.</li>
            <li>Form a study group to discuss challenging problems.</li>
            <li>Regularly attend office hours to clarify doubts.</li>
            <li>Aim to achieve an A in the course by the end of the semester.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Goal 3: Build a Strong Professional Network</h3>
        <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Building a network within the data science community will help me explore career opportunities and collaborate with like-minded individuals.</p>
        <p><strong>Action Plan:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attend at least two career fairs this semester to connect with industry professionals.</li>
            <li>Join student organizations related to data science and programming.</li>
            <li>Connect with professors and peers on LinkedIn.</li>
            <li>Apply for internships and research opportunities for the upcoming summer.</li>
        </ul>
